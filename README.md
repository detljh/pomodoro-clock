A [Pomodoro clock](https://detljh.github.io/pomodoro-clock/) created for a FreeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock) using React, Redux and CSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
